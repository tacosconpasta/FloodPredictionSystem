# FloodPredictionSystem

In Panama, and around the world, flooding is an immediate and almost unpredictable disaster. Its effects ripple through society, especially through those who reside in isolated geographical zones. These incidents cause transportation disruptions, damage to homes and infrastructure, crop losses, and, in some cases, endanger people's lives.

Furthermore, the lack of warning systems in many of these areas limit the ability to respond effectively to these catastrophical events. The problem, lies in the lack of early warning and accessible tools to help mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall on accesible terrain. This project seeks to develop a flood prediction system, using publically and locally available hydrological and meteorological data, that can provide general warning cues for civilian evacuation.
